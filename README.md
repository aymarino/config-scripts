# Configuration scripts

Collection of scripts I use to configure new environments and keep them in sync.

## VSCode extensions

* vim

## Former installs

```sh
brew_install_login_app mos # reverse scroll wheel direction
brew_install_login_app notunes
brew_install tmux
brew_install alacritty
```

## TODO

* Update VSCode settings from `*-setup.sh` scripts
